# Projects I've completed: 
# NOTICE: Due to a loss from a USB drive, this isn't the full exact list but relays a potential few

# - React Native Web and App design for Android, iPhone, and the standard web.
# - Used different APIs and Libraries to make a personal Alexa / Jarvis-like assistant, capabilities included Q&A's for math problems and general knowledge, as well as a wake feature that would activate only when a wake word was called
# - Implementation of Linked Lists, and operations within Trees and different data structures
# - Created own personal SR Latch within Logisim for one-bit memory, as well as half adders and full adders
# - GUI implementation using the Tkinter library in Python
# - Use of ElevenLabs AI and standard Google Python speech recognition, created a mod voice kit that would relay your voice into the voice of another

# Projects and other APIs I'm interested in learning/creating:
# - Cobalt -> Library for C++, similar to Eigen's C++ library but more catered towards matrices, algorithms, data structures, and Neural Networks
# - Contributing to Numpy open source
# - More Leetcode Problems
